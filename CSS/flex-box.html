<!-- 1. `display: flex;`
   - This property is used to define an element as a flex container.
   - It enables a flex context for its child elements.
   - By default, child elements will be laid out in a row, which is the main axis.

2. `flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;`
   - Determines the main axis along which flex items are laid out within the container.
   - Possible values:
     - `row` (default): Items are placed horizontally from left to right.
     - `row-reverse`: Items are placed horizontally from right to left.
     - `column`: Items are placed vertically from top to bottom.
     - `column-reverse`: Items are placed vertically from bottom to top.

3. `flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;`
   - Defines whether flex items should wrap to the next line when they don't fit in a single line.
   - Possible values:
     - `nowrap` (default): Items stay in a single line and may overflow the container.
     - `wrap`: Items wrap to the next line if necessary.
     - `wrap-reverse`: Items wrap to the next line, but in reverse order.

4. `flex-flow: <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>;`
   - A shorthand property that combines `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties.
   - Example: `flex-flow: row wrap;` sets the main axis to horizontal and allows items to wrap to the next line.

5. `justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;`
   - Determines how flex items are distributed along the main(x) axis.
   - Possible values:
     - `flex-start` (default): Items are aligned to the start of the main axis.
     - `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the main axis.
     - `center`: Items are centered along the main axis.
     - `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with space between them.
     - `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with space around them.
     - `space-evenly`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around and between them.

6. `align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center    - Specifies how flex items are aligned along the cross(y)-axis (perpendicular to the main axis).
   - Possible values:
     - `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the cross-axis.
     - `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the cross-axis.
     - `center`: Items are centered along the cross-axis.
      - `stretch` (default): Items are stretched to fill the container's cross-axis.

7. `align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch;`
   - Similar to `align-items`, but it aligns the flex lines (rows when `flex-direction` is row and columns when `flex-direction` is column) within the flex container.
   - It works when there is extra space along the cross-axis.
   - Possible values are the same as `align-items`.

8. `flex-grow: <number>;`
   - Specifies how flex items should grow to fill available space along the main axis.
   - A higher value will make an item grow more compared to others.

9. `flex-shrink: <number>;`
   - Specifies how flex items should shrink if there's not enough space along the main axis.
   - A higher value makes an item shrink more compared to others. -->
